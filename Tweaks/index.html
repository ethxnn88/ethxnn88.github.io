        <p>VisibleIsland is my first and currently only publicly released jailbreak tweak. As I release more, they will each get a writeup on this page.</p>
        <p>It's a tweak designed for notched iPhone models jailbroken running iOS 16.0 - 16.6.1 that allows the user to enable and modify the Dynamic Island on older devices.</p>
        <p>This tweak was originally just a little personal project to test my skills and learn something new, as I had never even understood any variant of the C programming language family prior to this. The tweak was originally just intended for personal use, and simply moved the Dynamic Island to below the notch so that it's more usable, and visible, hence the name.</p>
        <p>When I released it, the only options were to enable the Dynamic Island, and move the Dynamic Island to a lower position that was ideal for the users device, or set a custom position using X- and Y-offsets.</p>
        <p>There was instantly demand for more options, as it was a very sought-after tweak idea that a developer finally took the initiative to develop. In my next update, I added options to change the positioning of notification banners so that they're not covered by the Dynamic Island, and also an optiuon to hide the island when there wasn't an activity using it, as the black pill was pretty obtrusive.</p>
        <p>That update recieved pretty solid support, so I worked tirelessly to release a new version two weeks later, which is currently still the latest release as of early June. In this update, I added new options to change the color, opacity, and scale of the Dynamic Island, and also fixed a bug where the island would flicker and glitch if the user was using the "hide when not in use" feature.</p>
        <p>With the latest release, version 2.0, the user can truly customize the island to however they like. I haven't pushed an update since February, around four months ago as of writing this, but am planning to make revisions to it in the future.</p>
