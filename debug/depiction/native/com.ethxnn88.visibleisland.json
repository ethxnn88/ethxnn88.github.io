If your device isn't fully compatible, use the custom positioning instead.\n \n\n## Fully supported devices:\n- iPhone X\n- iPhone XS\n- iPhone 11 Pro\n- iPhone 13\n- iPhone 13 Pro\n- iPhone 14\n  \n  \n**Note**\n\nSome devices are currently set up using \"fake\" offsets calculated by setting the resolution on a device with the same size notch and finding a good position for the island. I'm not sure if these will work correctly on these devices, but ideally they should. Here's a list of the \"fake\" offset devices below.\n  \n  \n## \"Fake\" offset devices:\n- iPhone XR\n- iPhone 11\n- iPhone XS Max\n- iPhone 11 Pro Max\n- iPhone 13 Mini\n- iPhone 13 Pro Max\n \n \n**Version/jailbreak compatibility**\n\nFull support for iOS 16.0 - 16.6.1 rootless or roothide (bootstrap + serotonin)\n \n \n**Coming soon:**\n- More official device support\n- iPad support (v2.1?)\n- Fix the status bar size to accommodate for the Dynamic Island (maybe)\n\n**Known issues (fixes soon):**\n- Black rectangle behind some elements (i.e. timer or FaceID unlock glyph) when using a custom color and/or transparency\n- Red status bar (\ud83d\ude33 rdar:45025538) on iPhone XR and 11 - a separate fix already exists but I'll implement it into the tweak soon\n","useSpacing":"true","class":"DepictionMarkdownView"},{"class":"DepictionSpacerView"},{"class":"DepictionHeaderView","title":"Information"},{"class":"DepictionTableTextView","title":"Developer","text":"ethxnn88"},{"class":"DepictionTableTextView","title":"Version","text":"2.0"},{"class":"DepictionTableTextView","title":"Compatibility","text":"iOS 16.0 to 16.6.1"},{"class":"DepictionTableTextView","title":"Section","text":"Tweaks"},{"class":"DepictionSpacerView"},{"class":"DepictionTableButtonView","title":"View Source Code","action":"https://github.com/ethxnn88/VisibleIsland","openExternal":"true","tintColor":"#00a3ff"},{"class":"DepictionSpacerView"},{"class":"DepictionTableButtonView","title":"Contact Support","action":"depiction-https://ethxnn88.github.io/debug/depiction/native/help/com.ethxnn88.visibleisland.json","openExternal":"true","tintColor":"#00a3ff"},{"class":"DepictionLabelView","text":"Silica 1.2.2 \u2013 Updated 2024-02-24","textColor":"#999999","fontSize":"10.0","alignment":1}],"class":"DepictionStackView"},{"tabname":"Changelog","views":[{"class":"DepictionMarkdownView","markdown":"#### Version 2.0\n\nNew:\n- Fixed a bug where the Dynamic Island would flicker and shake when 'hide when not in use' is enabled\n- Added new options to customize the color of the Dynamic Island\n- Added a new option to hide the island outline\n- Added a new option to customize the scale of the Dynamic Island\n- Added a new option to set a custom transparency for the Dynamic Island"},{"class":"DepictionMarkdownView","markdown":"#### Version 1.1-b1\n\nNew features:\n- Added new option to disable the Dynamic Island when not in use\n- Added option to move notification banners to below the Dynamic Island\n- Added custom positioning for notification banners using custom X and Y offsets"},{"class":"DepictionMarkdownView","markdown":"#### Version 1.0-b1\n\nInitial beta release"},{"class":"DepictionLabelView","text":"Silica 1.2.2 \u2013 Updated 2024-02-24","textColor":"#999999","fontSize":"10.0","alignment":1}],"class":"DepictionStackView"}],"class":"DepictionTabView"}
