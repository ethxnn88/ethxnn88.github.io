If your device isn't fully compatible, use the custom positioning instead.\n\n**Fully supported devices:**\n- iPhone X (rootless untested, should work though)\n- iPhone XS\n- iPhone 11 Pro\n- iPhone 13\n- iPhone 13 Pro\n- iPhone 14\n\n**Version/jailbreak compatibility**\n\nFull support for iOS 16.0 - 16.6.1, currently only built for/tested on roothide (Serotonin) but should ideally work without a problem on rootless as well.\n\n**Coming soon:**\n- More official device support\n- Possible iPad support\n- Add options to customize the scale of the Dynamic Island\n- Add options to fix the position of notification banners (underneath the island) and/or set custom positioning\n","useSpacing":"true","class":"DepictionMarkdownView"},{"class":"DepictionSpacerView"},{"class":"DepictionHeaderView","title":"Information"},{"class":"DepictionTableTextView","title":"Developer","text":"ethxnn88"},{"class":"DepictionTableTextView","title":"Version","text":"1.0b1"},{"class":"DepictionTableTextView","title":"Compatibility","text":"iOS 16.0 to 16.6.1"},{"class":"DepictionTableTextView","title":"Section","text":"Tweaks"},{"class":"DepictionSpacerView"},{"class":"DepictionTableButtonView","title":"View Source Code","action":"https://github.com/ethxnn88/ethxnn88.github.io","openExternal":"true","tintColor":"#646363"},{"class":"DepictionSpacerView"},{"class":"DepictionTableButtonView","title":"Contact Support","action":"depiction-https://ethxnn88.github.io/depiction/native/help/com.ethxnn88.visibleisland.json","openExternal":"true","tintColor":"#646363"},{"class":"DepictionLabelView","text":"Silica 1.2.2 \u2013 Updated 2024-02-06","textColor":"#999999","fontSize":"10.0","alignment":1}],"class":"DepictionStackView"},{"tabname":"Changelog","views":[{"class":"DepictionMarkdownView","markdown":"#### Version 1.0b1\n\nFirst beta ;)"},{"class":"DepictionLabelView","text":"Silica 1.2.2 \u2013 Updated 2024-02-06","textColor":"#999999","fontSize":"10.0","alignment":1}],"class":"DepictionStackView"}],"class":"DepictionTabView"}
