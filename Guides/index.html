        <h2>Installing and Booting iOS 6 on the iPhone 5C</h2>
        <hr class="divider">
        <p>I remember back in 2019, seeing a video on Twitter by @Ralph0045 showing an iPhone 5C booting into iOS 6. At that point the video was over a year old already, and I figured that by then someone had probably explained how it was done somewhere.</p>
        <p>To my surprise, no one had made a guide, or even an explanation. I was dumbfounded. I was so intrigued by the fact that it was possible, and I wanted so badly to know how it was done.</p>
        <p>I spent the next 4 years checking the internet at random to see if anyone had ever posted an explanation, and I never found one. Then, in June 2021, I found a second video by @mcg29_ on Twitter showing another iPhone 5c booting iOS 6. This intrigued me even more, seeing yet another person somehow manage to boot iOS 6 on an iPhone 5C.</p>
        <p>In June of 2023, I decided to begin trying to learn as much about the iOS kernel as I could. You name it, I looked into it. During this research, the thought of booting iOS 6 on an iPhone 5C popped back into my head, and I decided to dedicate myself to figuring out how it was done, and trying to do it myself.</p>
        <p>From mid-June 2023 until the 20th of July 2023, I spent countless hours trying different things and trying my hardest to manage to get iOS 6 to boot, when finally, on July 21st 2023... I successfully installed and booted iOS 6 on an iPhone 5C.</p>
        <p>In all honesty, I mainly took up this project so that I could make my younger self proud. But secretly, I took up this project with intentions of A: being the third person to successfully do so and post proof online, and B: becoming the first, and currently only person to release a guide for it.</p>
        <p>Go ahead, spend a few hours looking around on the internet, you'll soon realize that the guide linked below is the ONLY one that exists.</p>

        <h2>Loading an iPod With Music Without iTunes Purchases</h2>
        <hr class="divider">
        <p>For the longest time, I had wanted to load up some music onto one of my older iPods. Just the thought of using a piece of technology from over 19 years ago to listen to music sounded so cool to me.</p>
        <p>This was something I wanted to do since around 2020. But only one issue - I didn't have a library of MP3 files to load up, and I didn't have the money to purchase all the songs I wanted. So I kind of just left the idea in the back of my mind up until just recently.</p>
        <p>As of writing this, around 3 months ago, I finally found a reputable and reliable way to do this. It's a simple and straightforward method to obtain local MP3 files for as many songs as you need, for 100% free of charge.</p>
        <p>This method involves creating a Spotify playlist containing all of the songs you want, and then using a Telegram bot to download all of the desired music to local MP3 files.</p>
