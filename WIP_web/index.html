        <p>Hello! My name is Ethan, a tech enthusiast who goes by the alias of ethxnn88 online. I'm intrigued about how electronics work, and interested in the engineering process of them.</p>
        <p> I'm also interested in software development, and have a bit of experience writing in languages such as python and objective-c++. I'd love to learn more about writing swift and using Xcode more, and delving into SwiftUI and UI design in general.</p>
        <p>Some personal hobbies of mine are collecting older "rare" and "legacy" Apple devices, such as iPods, iPads, and most importantly iPhones. With my coding knowledge, I write iOS Jailbreak tweaks whenever I have an idea of something I'd like different on one of my old Jailbroken iDevices. So far, I've only perfected and released one of my many tweaks, but I have plans to release more in the future. I also purchase damaged and sometimes even nonfunctional Apple devices from eBay, and proceeding to repair and re-sell them for a profit.</p>
        <p>In addition, I run a YouTube channel where I make videos showcasing these devices, such as unboxing, jailbreaking, downgrading or repairing them. I often make videos unboxing and reviewing new and somewhat-old devices, and also make videos about the unboxing and repair process of my beforementioned eBay flips.</p>
        <p>I also sometimes spend my free time delving into complicated projects such as my iPhone 5C iOS 6 port project, where after an unnecessary amount of struggling led to me sucessfully booting iOS 6 on an iPhone 5C.</p>
        <p>This website was also one of my projects. I was interested in getting into web design, and I came to the conclusion that the easiest way to get started was to write my own website.</p>
        <p>Feel free to check out some of my other projects and guides using the buttons in the menu bar, and check out my socials at the bottom of the page.</p>
        <p>Have a nice day!</p>
